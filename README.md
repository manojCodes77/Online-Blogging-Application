# React Native with NativeWind Template

This is a custom React Native template project with NativeWind integration, providing you with a streamlined starting point for building beautifully styled React Native applications using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## What's Included

This template comes pre-configured with:

- **React Native (Expo)**: A framework for building native apps using React
- **NativeWind v2**: Tailwind CSS framework for React Native
- **Babel Configuration**: Properly set up to support NativeWind
- **Example Components**: Demonstrating NativeWind usage


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- Expo Go app (for testing on physical devices)


### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/codermanoj2023/06-connecting-react-native-with-native-wind.git
cd 06-connecting-react-native-with-native-wind
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go (scan the QR code with your device)


## NativeWind Setup (Already Configured)

This template already has NativeWind properly configured with:

- NativeWind v2 and TailwindCSS 3.3.2 installed
- Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Babel plugin added to `babel.config.js`
- Required imports in the main component files


### Important Version Notes

This template uses:

- `nativewind@^2.0.0`
- `tailwindcss@3.3.2` (NativeWind v2 doesn't work with TailwindCSS >3.3.2)[^2]


## Using NativeWind in This Template

NativeWind allows you to use Tailwind CSS classes directly in your React Native components:

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-white p-4">
      <Text className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-500">Hello NativeWind!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```


### Key Features

- Write Tailwind classes with the `className` prop (works thanks to NativeWind's Babel plugin)
- Style your components with concise, utility-first CSS classes
- Maintain a consistent design language across your app
- Utilize responsive design with NativeWind's mobile-first approach


## Project Structure

This project uses file-based routing with files inside the **app** directory. You can start developing by editing these files.

## Customizing Tailwind

If you want to customize your Tailwind configuration:

1. Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to add custom colors, spacing, etc.
2. Make sure any new component directories are included in the `content` array:
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./App.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Your customizations here
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- **Styles not applying**: Make sure to restart the development server after making changes to the Babel config
- **"Unable to resolve module 'nativewind'"**: Check that you've installed all dependencies correctly
- **React Native Web issues**: For web support, you may need additional configuration
